3. Once youâ€™ve completed translating all texts, save the JSON file using the appropriate language code (e.g., `ar`, `de`, `es_es`, `fr`, `ja`, etc.).

### For Updating an Existing Localization:
1. Load the target localization file by clicking **Load Target Translation**.

2. The tool will automatically detect and add any missing keys, marking them in red for translation.

3. If the source text and the target text are identical, it will also be marked in red for review. You can choose to ignore these.
